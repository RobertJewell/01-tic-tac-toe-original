This is a very basic version of the react docs' tic tac toe game.
The tutorial for it can be found here: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

This version has no extra features (and hopefully no extra bugs)

## FAQ

#### Is is pretty?

No

Yes

...At least in the sense that it works, not in the react function components sense.

Probably not

There are some small tweaks to improve readability, but not many.

It's just react
